## 🧐 What's the Tea?

Tired of manually writing JSON mock data? Exhausting. 😩
**TS Mock Gen** takes your TypeScript interfaces and *poof* ✨ turns them into realistic JSON data using [Faker.js](https://fakerjs.dev/).

It's giving **Productivity**. It's giving **Efficiency**. It's giving **Developer Experience**. 🚀

## 🔥 Features that Slap

*   **TypeScript Parsing:** We read your types so you don't have to explain yourself. 🧠
*   **Smart Mapping:** We guess what you need. `email` -> Real Email. `avatar` -> Real Image. We got you. 🤝
*   **Custom Rules:** Want a specific format? Override our logic. You're the main character. 👑
*   **Faker.js Powered:** The GOAT of mock data generation. 🐐
*   **Real-time Preview:** See the results as you type. Instant gratification. ⚡

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  **Paste your TS Interface** on the left.
2.  (Optional) **Tweak the Rules** in the middle if you're feeling picky.
3.  **Grab your JSON** from the right. Copy it, download it, do whatever. 📦

## 🛠️ The Stack

Built with the freshest ingredients:

*   ⚛️ **React** - Cause we have taste.
*   ⚡ **Vite** - Fast AF.
*   📘 **TypeScript** - Type safety is self-care.
*   🎨 **TailwindCSS** - Looking good is half the battle.
*   🎭 **Faker.js** - The real MVP.
